The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework for
communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS
consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base
group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability, the Temporal group
reflects the characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time, and the
Environmental group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are
unique to a user's environment. The Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0
to 10, which can then be modified by scoring the Temporal and Environmental
metrics.
